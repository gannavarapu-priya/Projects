# Information Visualization  
Developed an interactive multi-view dashboard for high-dimensional data exploration using D3.js and web technologies.

# Visualizing High-Dimensional Data with Coordinated Multiple Views

## Overview
This project demonstrates interactive visualization techniques to explore high-dimensional data using coordinated multiple views. Implemented with D3.js, the dashboard supports parallel coordinates, scatter plots, bar charts, and brushing to allow intuitive exploration of relationships and patterns.

## Goal
The main objective is to design a visual analytics dashboard that enables users to:
- Filter and compare data across multiple dimensions
- Discover patterns and correlations in high-dimensional datasets
- Use brushing and linking to support interactive exploration

## Dataset
### Source
- **Dataset**: Car dataset (CSV format)
- **Source**: Sample dataset for academic visualization project

### Description
The dataset includes multiple car attributes such as mileage, horsepower, cylinders, origin, and displacement. These attributes are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of coordinated views in exploring multi-dimensional data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Introduction
- Presents the importance of high-dimensional data visualization
- Describes the dataset and user tasks
- Introduces core visualization goals: filtering, correlation discovery, and comparison

### 2. Visualization Techniques and Design
- **Parallel Coordinates Plot** for multi-variable comparison
- **Linked Scatter Plots and Bar Charts** for drill-down and feature interaction
- **Brushing and Linking** for filtering across all views
- **Tooltip and Highlighting** for contextual insights

### 3. Interaction and Implementation
- Uses D3.js for DOM manipulation and SVG rendering
- Responsive layout using HTML/CSS
- Interactions implemented with mouse events and data binding

---

## Results
- Demonstrates coordinated filtering and brushing
- Reveals patterns among car attributes (e.g., high horsepower vs. low MPG)
- Shows how visual encoding supports multidimensional comparison

---

## Technologies and Tools
- **Programming Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Visualization Library**: D3.js
- **Tools**: VS Code, GitHub
